                <strong>Function Scope : </strong>
                <span class="design">
                  Variables declared with var are function-scoped. They are only
                  accessible within the function where they are defined.
                </span>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Hoisting : </strong>
                <span class="design">
                  Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their
                  containing function or global scope, meaning you can use them
                  before they are declared, but they will be initialized with
                  undefined until their actual declaration.

                <span class="design">
                  Variables declared with let are block-scoped, meaning they are
                  accessible only within the block where they are defined. A
                  block can be a function, loop, or any code enclosed in curly
                  braces {}.

                <span class="design">
                  Variables declared with let are also hoisted to the top of
                  their containing block, but they are not initialized, so you
                  can't use them before their declaration.
                </span>

                <span class="design">
                  Variables declared with const are meant to be constants, and
                  their value cannot be reassigned after initialization.
                  However, for objects and arrays declared with const, you can
                  still modify their properties or elements; you just can't
                  reassign the variable itself.

                <strong>Explicit Absence of Value :</strong>
                <span class="design">
                  null is a value that represents the intentional absence of any
                  object value or value in general. It is typically used when
                  you want to indicate that a variable or property should have
                  no value or that it has been intentionally cleared.

              <li>
                <strong>As a Placeholder :</strong>
                <span class="design">
                  It can also be used as a placeholder or initial value that
                  might be assigned a value later in your code.
                </span>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Returned by Functions :</strong>
                <span class="design">
                  Some functions or methods may return null to indicate that
                  they did not find a meaningful result.
                </span>
              </li>

            <p>undefined :</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Default Value :</strong>
                <span class="design">
                  In JavaScript, variables that have been declared but have not
                  been assigned a value are automatically initialized with
                  undefined. So, undefined is often used as the default value
                  for function parameters and variables.
                </span>

                <span class="design">
                  If you try to access an object property that does not exist,
                  you will get undefined.
                </span>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Array Elements :</strong>
                <span class="design">
                  When you access an array element that is beyond the current
                  length of the array, you get undefined.
                </span>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Function Return :</strong>
                <span class="design">
                  If a function does not explicitly return a value, it returns
                  undefined.

            <p>REST API :</p>
            <span>
              A <strong>REST API</strong> is an application programming
              interface that adheres to the constraints of REST architectural
              style and enables interaction with RESTful web services.
              Interconnected networks make up the web. A web service is a set of
              open protocols and standards used for exchanging data between
              client-server applications. Web services that follow the REST
              architecture are known as RESTful web services.
